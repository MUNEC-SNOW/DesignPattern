# DesignPattern
This repo is aim to learning Design Pattern based on Head First
## 1 Strategy Pattern
    Strategy is a Pattern which define a Algorithm 
    Cluster. packaged the clusters separately in 
    order to make them replace each other, this 
    pattern can let the change of algorithm independent 
    of the people who use them.
## 2 Observer Pattern
    Observer is a pattern which define one-to-many 
    relation dependency between objects. When one 
    of the objects' condition changes, all objects 
    that depend on it will get notified and update 
    itself automatically.
## 3 Decorator Pattern 
    Decorator is a pattern which add some things to
    an exist object dynamically. If you want to extends
    funcions, decorator provide another choise that
    differ from inheritance.
## 4 Factory Pattern
    Factory is a pattern that definea interface for create
    objects. However, the object which need to be instantiate
    is chosen by the child clas. Factory function make te 
    instanitiate delay from class to its child class.
## 5 Singleton Pattern
    Singleton is a pattern which make sure that only one  
    instantce of the object will be create, and provides a 
    global access point.
